Aren Herbs are a small herb that spawn in all colder Biomes.
when fed to horses they receive the frost walker effect, enabling them to freeze water under their hooves.

But don't try to eat the herbs yourself! Only horse stomachs are strong enough to digest the herbs.

On rare occasions, a Wandering Trader might have some herbs for sale, but these rare herbs are on high demand.

It is best to look for them in colder biomes and then grow them yourself.
